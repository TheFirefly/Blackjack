Blackjack
=========

1. The win calculation when you split your hand is not accurate since I did not have enough time to complete the methods to compare both hands against the dealer's
2. My split method is the single best feature. The fact that it resizes the cards and manages both hands so efficiently is pretty cool.
3. Classes in Java allow you to split the complicated code into objects that can manage themselves and can be used to implement logical features that would just overcomplicate a single class.
4. A private variable cannot be accessed from the outside of the class (cannot be modified) while a public variable can. A private method can only be used by the class itself, vs. a public method that can be accessed by all outside classes.
5. A class contains the object's methods and parameters while an instance is the actual object itself that can be used to call upon its methods (instances can also be stored or future use while a class is just the "template")
6. Inheritance is simply the relationship between 1 class and another. One class can be similar to another base class and "extend" it. This can be useful when 2 objects have very similar properties but behave differently - they would both extend the same base class.
7. "this" simply refers to the current class you are in. "super" refers to the base class of the current class.
8. 2 properties: methods (actions) and instance variables (parameters, descriptors)
9. Abstract classes (when using the implement keyword I think)
